When you very nearly spray a mouthful of drink over the person in front of you, its generally a good indicator the movie is pretty funny. The sandwich joke had me in stitches! This movie doesn't rely on just a few jokes to carry it, they maintain a subtle layer of humour throughout and then have you in stitches with some brilliant jokes. The cast in this movie are well picked and really gets the whole dilemma of everyday life as a vampire! Hopefully this gets picked up and the masses get a chance to enjoy this wee gem. Loved this movie and would definitely recommend it. Gave this a 10. A must see!!


Negative one

It's a refreshing idea but this is amateur hour and looks like a film made by a bunch of film students. I didn't laugh once, not even a giggle. 95% of it is filmed inside a dark house which just adds to the dreariness of it all. It's slow and I can't see it going into cinema release in the states. I have liked a few oddball comedies from New Zeland but I will remember this one for all the wrong reasons. Just awful!
